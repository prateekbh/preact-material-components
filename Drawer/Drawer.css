/**
 * Creates a rule that will be applied when an MDC-Web component is within the context of an RTL layout.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   position: absolute;
 *   left: 0;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     left: auto;
 *     right: 0;
 *   }
 *
 *   &__bar {
 *     margin-left: 4px;
 *     @include mdc-rtl(".mdc-foo") {
 *       margin-left: auto;
 *       margin-right: 4px;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * .mdc-foo--mod {
 *   padding-left: 4px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     padding-left: auto;
 *     padding-right: 4px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that this works by checking for [dir="rtl"] on an ancestor element. While this will work
 * in most cases, it will in some cases lead to false negatives, e.g.
 *
 * ```html
 * <html dir="rtl">
 *   <!-- ... -->
 *   <div dir="ltr">
 *     <div class="mdc-foo">Styled incorrectly as RTL!</div>
 *   </div>
 * </html>
 * ```
 *
 * In the future, selectors such as :dir (http://mdn.io/:dir) will help us mitigate this.
 */
/**
 * Takes a base box-model property - e.g. margin / border / padding - along with a default
 * direction and value, and emits rules which apply the value to the
 * "<base-property>-<default-direction>" property by default, but flips the direction
 * when within an RTL context.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, left, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   margin-left: 8px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 8px;
 *     margin-left: 0;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * whereas:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, right, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   margin-right: 8px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 0;
 *     margin-left: 8px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass a 4th optional $root-selector argument which will be forwarded to `mdc-rtl`,
 * e.g. `@include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box-property(margin, left, 8px, ".mdc-component")`.
 *
 * Note that this function will always zero out the original value in an RTL context. If you're
 * trying to flip the values, use mdc-rtl-reflexive-property().
 */
/**
 * Takes a base property and emits rules that assign <base-property>-left to <left-value> and
 * <base-property>-right to <right-value> in a LTR context, and vice versa in a RTL context.

 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-property(margin, auto, 12px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *

/**

 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-position(left, 0);
 *   position: absolute;

 *
 *    @include mdc-rtl {

/**
 * Creates a rule that will be applied when an MDC-Web component is within the context of an RTL layout.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   position: absolute;
 *   left: 0;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     left: auto;
 *     right: 0;
 *   }
 *
 *   &__bar {
 *     margin-left: 4px;
 *     @include mdc-rtl(".mdc-foo") {
 *       margin-left: auto;
 *       margin-right: 4px;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * .mdc-foo--mod {
 *   padding-left: 4px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     padding-left: auto;
 *     padding-right: 4px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that this works by checking for [dir="rtl"] on an ancestor element. While this will work
 * in most cases, it will in some cases lead to false negatives, e.g.
 *
 * ```html
 * <html dir="rtl">
 *   <!-- ... -->
 *   <div dir="ltr">
 *     <div class="mdc-foo">Styled incorrectly as RTL!</div>
 *   </div>
 * </html>
 * ```
 *
 * In the future, selectors such as :dir (http://mdn.io/:dir) will help us mitigate this.

 * direction and value, and emits rules which apply the value to the
 * "<base-property>-<default-direction>" property by default, but flips the direction
 * when within an RTL context.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, left, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 8px;
 *     margin-left: 0;

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 0;
 *     margin-left: 8px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass a 4th optional $root-selector argument which will be forwarded to `mdc-rtl`,
 * e.g. `@include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box-property(margin, left, 8px, ".mdc-component")`.
 *
 * Note that this function will always zero out the original value in an RTL context. If you're
 * trying to flip the values, use mdc-rtl-reflexive-property().
